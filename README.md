# Network Golden Config Drift Monitor

A Python-based tool that pulls network device configurations via an existing management API and compares them against defined 'Golden Configurations' to detect and report drift. Designed for network engineers to maintain fleet-wide compliance.

## Guidance

Must handle dynamic variables (like IPs) to avoid false positives during comparison. Focus on integration with existing management APIs rather than direct SSH.

## Tech Stack

Python, FastAPI
