## Introduction




Historical Drift Logs (F5) provide a perennial repository of configuration audit results, bridging the gap between real-time detection and long-term forensic analysis. In enterprise environments, understanding 'when' a device deviated from its Golden Config is as critical as knowing 'that' it deviated. This feature enables Network Architects and Compliance Engineers to transition from reactive troubleshooting to pro-active root cause analysis by maintaining an immutable timeline of drift events. By storing detailed delta reports and providing indexed search capabilities by device ID and timestamp, NetGuard ensures that teams can perform historical audits, satisfy regulatory compliance requirements, and significantly reduce Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) by pinpointing the exact moment a 'snowflake' configuration was introduced.
